# Buggy FizzBuzz

Here are the FizzBuzz rules:

* If number is divisible by 3, return "fizz"
* If number is divisible by 5, return "buzz"
* If number is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz"
* Otherwise, return the number (as a string)

## Instructions

* Run the main application
* Run the tests - they should pass
* You should discover hat the code is buggy
* Write a test that shows there's a bug - it should **fail** - you can
  get inspiration from the existing `Calculator.add` test
* Fix the bug
* Test should now **pass**
